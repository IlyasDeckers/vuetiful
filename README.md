# Vuetiful
> A very opinionated Vue.js framework for rapid SPA development.

## Introduction
Vuetiful originated from a personal repository that was used on daily basis to speed up the development process and to provide a standardized way to work in teams on larger projects. The use cases are wide; test new ideas, prototype, build production-ready SPA's,... This repository will be updated at a regular basis as this Vuetiful still a WIP.

The goal of this project is to help Vue developers build quality applications in no time. This framework is highly customizable once you get the core concepts down. Fork the repository and start building!
